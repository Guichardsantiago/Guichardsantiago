# Hi! 👋 I'm Santiago

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an option trading platform in Django 🐍
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React ⚛️ and Solidity 🔹
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web3 projects! 🚀

Overall I just like to learn and build new cool stuff, I'm not in love with any technology/language/framework in particular, for me all of them are just tools to get things done. So wether is js, C#, SQL, CSS, frontend, backend or whateverend just bring it on and let's see what we can do. Afterall there is nothing that a couple of hours digging into stackoverflow while having a mate 🧉 cannot solve.
